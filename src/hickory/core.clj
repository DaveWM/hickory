  ;; Oh god. Oh God. This. is. *heinous*.
  ;;
  ;; Jsoup, excellent parser, has a bug in Parser/parseFragment when you do not
  ;; supply the context arg. It has an uninitialized variable that causes an
  ;; NPE. So, I found this problem and reported it. Haven't heard back. Project
  ;; won't build for me, and I can't figure out why.
  ;;
  ;; So, after hours spent on this, it's time to make a strategic retreat to
  ;; awfulness, and use the function that does work: parseBodyFragment. This
  ;; parse the fragment into an entire html/head/body structure. We'll let it
  ;; do that, and then *gulp* find the thing we wanted in that body and pull it
  ;; back out.
  ;;
  ;; Seriously, soon as they fix parseFragment, fix this. The code should be
  ;; (as-hiccup (Parser/parseFragment s nil "")) or something close.
